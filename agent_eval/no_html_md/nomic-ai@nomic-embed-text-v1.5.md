# nomic-embed-text-v1.5: Resizable Production Embeddings with Matryoshka Representation Learning  
[Blog](https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/nomic-embed-text-v1) | [Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01613) | [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=seller-tpqidcj54zawi) | [Nomic Platform](https://atlas.nomic.ai)
**Exciting Update!**: `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` is now multimodal! [nomic-embed-vision-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-vision-v1.5) is aligned to the embedding space of `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`, meaning any text embedding is multimodal!
**Important**: the text prompt *must* include a *task instruction prefix*, instructing the model which task is being performed. 
For example, if you are implementing a RAG application, you embed your documents as `search_document: ` and embed your user queries as `search_query: `.
**Notice**: From transformers v5.5.0 and sentence transformers v5.3.0, `trust_remote_code=True` will no longer be necessary. This will only be possible with the text-only series as of now.
#### Purpose: embed texts as documents from a dataset
This prefix is used for embedding texts as documents, for example as documents for a RAG index.
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5")
sentences = ['search_document: TSNE is a dimensionality reduction algorithm created by Laurens van Der Maaten']
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
#### Purpose: embed texts as questions to answer
This prefix is used for embedding texts as questions that documents from a dataset could resolve, for example as queries to be answered by a RAG application.
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5")
sentences = ['search_query: Who is Laurens van Der Maaten?']
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
#### Purpose: embed texts to group them into clusters
This prefix is used for embedding texts in order to group them into clusters, discover common topics, or remove semantic duplicates.
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5")
sentences = ['clustering: the quick brown fox']
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
#### Purpose: embed texts to classify them
This prefix is used for embedding texts into vectors that will be used as features for a classification model
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5")
sentences = ['classification: the quick brown fox']
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
import torch.nn.functional as F
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5")
sentences = ['search_query: What is TSNE?', 'search_query: Who is Laurens van der Maaten?']
embeddings = model.encode(sentences, convert_to_tensor=True)
embeddings = F.layer_norm(embeddings, normalized_shape=(embeddings.shape[1],))
embeddings = embeddings[:, :matryoshka_dim]
embeddings = F.normalize(embeddings, p=2, dim=1)
import torch.nn.functional as F
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
def mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):
    token_embeddings = model_output[0]
    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()
    return torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)
sentences = ['search_query: What is TSNE?', 'search_query: Who is Laurens van der Maaten?']
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5')
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')
    model_output = model(**encoded_input)
embeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input['attention_mask'])
+ embeddings = F.layer_norm(embeddings, normalized_shape=(embeddings.shape[1],))
+ embeddings = embeddings[:, :matryoshka_dim]
embeddings = F.normalize(embeddings, p=2, dim=1)
The model natively supports scaling of the sequence length past 2048 tokens. To do so, 
- tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
+ tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', model_max_length=8192)
- model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5')
+ rope_parameters = {"rope_theta": 1000.0, "rope_type": "dynamic", "factor": 2.0}
+ model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5', rope_parameters=rope_parameters)
import { pipeline, layer_norm } from '@huggingface/transformers';
// Create a feature extraction pipeline
const extractor = await pipeline('feature-extraction', 'nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5');
const texts = ['search_query: What is TSNE?', 'search_query: Who is Laurens van der Maaten?'];
// Compute sentence embeddings
let embeddings = await extractor(texts, { pooling: 'mean' });
console.log(embeddings); // Tensor of shape [2, 768]
embeddings = layer_norm(embeddings, [embeddings.dims[1]])
    .slice(null, [0, matryoshka_dim])
console.log(embeddings.tolist());
The easiest way to use Nomic Embed is through the Nomic Embedding API.
Generating embeddings with the `nomic` Python client is as easy as 
    texts=['Nomic Embedding API', '#keepAIOpen'],
    model='nomic-embed-text-v1.5',
For more information, see the [API reference](https://docs.nomic.ai/reference/endpoints/nomic-embed-text)
Usage with [Infinity](https://github.com/michaelfeil/infinity).
docker run --gpus all -v $PWD/data:/app/.cache -e HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN -p "7997":"7997" \

`nomic-embed-text-v1.5` is an improvement upon [Nomic Embed](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1) that utilizes [Matryoshka Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147) which gives developers the flexibility to trade off the embedding size for a negligible reduction in performance.

We train our embedder using a multi-stage training pipeline. Starting from a long-context [BERT model](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-bert-2048),
the first unsupervised contrastive stage trains on a dataset generated from weakly related text pairs, such as question-answer pairs from forums like StackExchange and Quora, title-body pairs from Amazon reviews, and summarizations from news articles.
In the second finetuning stage, higher quality labeled datasets such as search queries and answers from web searches are leveraged. Data curation and hard-example mining is crucial in this stage.

Training data to train the models is released in its entirety. For more details, see the `contrastors` [repository](https://github.com/nomic-ai/contrastors)
